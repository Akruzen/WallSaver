# Privacy Policy

None of your private and/or personal data is stored, shared, sold, transferred, processed or used for advertising any other kind of magic tricks. I could have written a long boring document regarding how I handle your data, but for that I would need to 
collect your data, which I don't. So instead of typing some contract language which none of us will understand, let me make something clear:  

  ``` I have no interest in your personal data, so you can be rest assured that no fishy business goes around here. And if you are very curious, you can always check the source code and verify it yourself! ```
