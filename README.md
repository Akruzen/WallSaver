# Wallsaver

Wallsaver is an Android Application which can help you download the wallpapers you apply with third party applications. This can help you to save the wallpapers to the device from third party wallpaper applications which do not support downloading of wallpapers.

## Usage
You can use this app in 2 ways:  
 - Use the "Set With" or any equivalent option in your third party app and then choose Wallsaver from the list to save to device.  
 - (TODO) If third party application does not support the "Set With" or any equivalent option, you can apply it directly and then extract the wallpaper to save to the device.

## Installation
You can download the latest apk from the [release section](https://github.com/Akruzen/WallSaver/releases).  
  
  Points to consider while installing:
- Make sure you are using Android Oreo (8.0) or above.
- Make sure you don't violate any third party applications' privacy policy and copyright infringement policy while using the app.

## Debugging
If you want to debug or compile the app yourself, you will need to install [Android Studio](<https://developer.android.com/studio>) or any other supported IDE.
Then clone this repository using

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Akruzen/WallSaver
```
